# Server
PORT=3500
BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0
# Used inside generated installers as <<SERVERURL>>.
# Set this to the URL clients will use to reach the server.
# Examples:
#   HTTP:  http://your-host:3500
#   HTTPS: https://your-host:3500
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3500

# Authentication
# Required: any request without X-Auth-Key will be silently dropped.
AUTH_KEY=CHANGE_ME
# Optional: separate high-trust key for /uploads and /download.

# TLS
# Set DISABLE_SSL=true to run HTTP mode.
# If DISABLE_SSL=false (HTTPS mode), provide either:
# - TLS_PFX_FILE (a .pfx/.p12 bundle from your hosting provider), OR
# - TLS_KEY_FILE + TLS_CERT_FILE (PEM key + PEM certificate/chain)
# Tip: when using HTTPS, set SERVER_URL to https://... so installers point at the correct scheme.
DISABLE_SSL=true
CERTS_DIR=certs
# Required when DISABLE_SSL=false (filenames within CERTS_DIR unless absolute paths)
TLS_PFX_FILE=
# Optional passphrase for PFX bundles
TLS_PFX_PASSPHRASE=
TLS_KEY_FILE=
TLS_CERT_FILE=
# Optional:
# - Most setups do NOT need TLS_CA_FILE.
# - Prefer putting the full certificate chain (server cert + intermediates) into TLS_CERT_FILE.
# - TLS_CA_FILE is mainly useful for client certificate validation (mTLS) or special chain setups.
TLS_CA_FILE=

# CORS
# Use * to allow all, or comma-separated list: https://example.com,https://other.com
CORS_ORIGINS=*

# Optional: unauthenticated DCV validation path for certificate authorities
